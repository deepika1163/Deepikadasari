This Python script simulates an ATM machine with essential features: balance inquiry, cash deposit, cash withdrawal, PIN change, and transaction history. 
The ATM class handles these functions securely, and the atm_menu function provides a simple text-based user interface for interaction.
The script starts with default PIN and balance, guiding the user through various ATM operations.
